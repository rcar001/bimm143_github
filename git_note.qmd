## Basic of using Git

Git is a distributed version of control system (VCS) that is very popular. 

The core steps to using git involve:

1. Initiate a git repository 

  In RStudio we just click the wee little radio button on project creation. At the command line we type: `git init`
  
  
2. Do your normal work.
  Add files
  Modify files
  etc. 
 
  
3. Add your important files to the "stage" 
  In Rstudio we click the "stage" radio vutton 
  `git add youfilename`
  
  
4. Commit your staged files tot he repository
  In RStudio you just hit the "commit" button and add a msg.
  `git commit -m "Your wee msg`
  
  
You can change your "history" and status 
`git status`
`git log` (push Q to exit)
